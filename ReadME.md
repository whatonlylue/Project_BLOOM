# Project BLOOM

Welcome to Project BLOOM, which stands for: BLOOM: Behavioral Learning and Outcome Observation in Microbes. This project aims to fit a machine learning model to adapt to bacteria genomes to eventually predict there properties, with an end goal of dynamic vaccine creation. 

### Usecases

Intended functionality is as follows, enter an unknown bacteria genome, then get an output of predicted genotypes and phenotypes. 

### Packages

Current packages:

    Data: All data collected for the model is stored here
    Data_collection_tools: All data collection tools are in this directory

### Next Steps

Looking to add AI functionality and expand our data set
