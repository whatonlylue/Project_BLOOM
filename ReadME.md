# Project BLOOM

Welcome to Project BLOOM, which stands for: BLOOM: Behavioral Learning and Outcome Observation in Microbes. This project aims to fit a machine learning model to adapt to bacteria genomes to eventually predict there properties, with an end goal of dynamic vaccine creation. 

### Usecases

Intended functionality is as follows, enter an unknown bacteria genome, then get an output of predicted genotypes and phenotypes. 

### Packages

Current packages:

    Data: All data collected for the model is stored here
    Data_collection_tools: All data collection tools are in this directory

### Next Steps

Looking to add AI functionality and expand our data set

### Requirments

Inorder to use this package, you must have conda install on your device, instructions to install conda can be found here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/


Once you have done that you also need to create an ncbi_dataset environment, which can be found here:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/download-and-install/ (Please follow the conda install, ***If you do not follow them, this project will not work***)
